# Machine-Learning-AI

* Solutions in Pattern Recognition folder
  
  * TreeRecognitionProject.ipynb -file
    * As a group we created a dataset which consists overall 136 pictures of different tree species (Maple, Juniper, Birch, Pine, Spruce)
      * Dataset was split 106 pictures for training / 30 pictures for validation
        
    * For Machine Learning part we used pre-trained ResNet18 model and added some more training into model of our specific purposes
      * Our model predicts 25/30 of validation data right   
    * Finally we created Gradio interface for live classification tasks
